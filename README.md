# HackOSsim

Welcome to the HackOSsim Project! This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with operating systems, utilizing the QEMU Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator. The primary focus is on customizing embedded operating systems to implement new features and evaluating their performance under significant workloads.

## Project Overview

Explore the different aspects of this project:

- [**QEMU Installation and Usage**](./docs/qemu.md): Learn the essentials of using QEMU for running embedded operating systems. The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for installation and usage.

## Getting Started

To begin, follow the instructions in the [QEMU Installation and Usage](./docs/qemu.md) to install and use QEMU with the chosen embedded operating system. Each section is designed to be self-contained, allowing you to focus on specific aspects of the project.
