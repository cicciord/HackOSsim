\section{Memory Management}

A custom memory management library has been implemented. The library is a modifies version of the \textit{heap\_4.c} implementation provided by FreeRTOS.

In the provided implementation it has been implemented the \textit{realloc} function, among with \textit{best-fit} and \textit{worst-fit} allocation strategy.

\subsection{Realloc}
    \subsubsection{Implementation}
    The implementation of the realloc function is the following.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=c,breaklines]
    void *pvPortRealloc(void *pv, size_t xWantedSize);
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function takes two arguments, the pointer to the memory block to be reallocated and the new size of the memory block. The function returns a pointer to the reallocated memory block.

    In case a NULL pointer is passed as the first argument, the function behaves as a malloc call. In case the second argument is 0, the function behaves as a free call.
    
    In any other case the funcion will try to reallocate the memory block, after checking that the pointer corresponds to a valid memory block.

    The reallocation is implemented in the following way:

    \begin{codebox}
    \begin{lstlisting}
    BlockLink_t * pxLink;
    void * pvReturn = NULL;
    uint8_t * puc = ( uint8_t * ) pv;
    size_t xBlockSize;
    size_t xMoveSize;

    /* The memory being reallocated will have an BlockLink_t structure immediately
        * before it. */
    puc -= xHeapStructSize;

    /* This casting is to keep the compiler from issuing warnings. */
    pxLink = ( void * ) puc;
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{codebox}

    \begin{codebox}
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=c]
    /* The size of the block being reallocated */
    xBlockSize = ( pxLink->xBlockSize & ~heapBLOCK_ALLOCATED_BITMASK ) - xHeapStructSize;

    /* Allocate new memory block */
    pvReturn = pvPortMalloc( xWantedSize );

    if( pvReturn != NULL )
    {
        /* The size of the memory to copy */
        xMoveSize = xBlockSize < xWantedSize ? xBlockSize : xWantedSize;

        /* Copy the memory to the new location */
        memcpy( pvReturn, pv, xMoveSize );

        /* Free old memory block */
        vPortFree(pv);
    } 
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{codebox}

    Notice that FreeRTOS use the first bit of the block size to store the allocation status of the block. For this reason if a block is allocated the size of the block is obtained by clearing the first bit of the block size.
