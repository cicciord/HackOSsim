\section{Practical Projects}
Practical projects have been developed to demonstrate how to develope applications using QEMU and FreeRTOS on a Cortex-M3 microcontroller.

For all projects, the NUCLEO-F103RB development board is used. The choice of the board is based on the fact that the Nucleo boards are designed to be very affordable, and they are also very popular among hobbyists and students.

The projects are startupped with the help of the STM32CubeMX tool, which is a graphical software configuration tool, provided by STMicroelectronics, that allows generating C initialization code using a graphical interface.
