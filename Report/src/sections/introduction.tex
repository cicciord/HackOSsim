The HackOSsim project consist in the exploration and improvement of FreeRTOS embedded OS within the context of QEMU, an ISA simulator.

Among the primary objectives of the project is the mastery of QEMU, a comprehensive tutorial is provided that outlines the installation and the usage procedures of the ISA simulator to emulate an ARM system. Moreover practical examples are developed to illustrate the functionalities of FreeRTOS.

The last part of the project lies in the development of a new functionality in the memory management of FreeRTOS and testing the correct functioning of the developed code.
